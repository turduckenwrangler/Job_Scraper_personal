"""
Triage Agent Evals
Golden-case evaluations for triage_agent.py: synthetic job postings with known-correct
outcomes, run through the EXACT production pipeline (build_static_prefix →
build_job_prompt → model → parse_verdict). A case fails when the verdict violates its
expectations (score bounds, allowed verdicts, required flags, role family).

This tests the profile + prompt + model as ONE system: a profile edit, a prompt tweak,
or a model swap can each silently shift scoring — the evals catch the shift before the
nightly run publishes 300 bad verdicts to the dashboard.

Origin story: in June 2026 the agent scored PhD-required roles as strong matches
because the profile never said the candidate holds an M.S., not a PhD. Case
`phd-required-dream-biotech` is the regression test for exactly that.

Backends are the same as triage_agent.py (API key in CI, logged-in `claude` CLI
locally — no key needed). The cases are synthetic and contain no private profile
details; the profile/resume themselves still come from the gitignored files or
Actions secrets, same as production.

Usage:
  python3 eval_triage.py                 # run all cases once
  python3 eval_triage.py --only phd      # run cases whose id contains "phd"
  python3 eval_triage.py --runs 3        # repeat the suite, report per-case pass rate

# Golden cases
#
# expect keys (all optional, all must hold):
#   min_score / max_score  — inclusive bounds on the 0-100 score
#   verdicts               — verdict must be one of these
#   flag_re                — case-insensitive regex that must match >= 1 flag
#   families               — role_family must be one of these
#   forbid_tokens          — none of these strings may appear (case-insensitive)
#                            in why/flags/outreach_opener. Use None as the value
#                            in a case: main() fills it at runtime from the
#                            secret profile/resume, so this PUBLIC file never
#                            contains the candidate's name or employers.
